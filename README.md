# Entity-Framework-Core
The course "Entity Framework Core" follows in detail the work with the ORM technology: Entity Framework Core (EF core), which is a standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational base and an object-oriented model through appropriate "database first" and "code first" and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and performing CRUD operations. EF core provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process the data from the database. In the course, I learn about established practices for building a database layer of complex systems in C# applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and using the service layer (Service Layer), as well as importing and exporting to different data formats (JSON, XML).
Skills I have acquired:
- Building a database architecture
- Using the Code First approach
- Using the Database First approach
- Retrieve data using LINQ queries
- Working with a database using an ORM
- Work with different data formats - XML, JSON
